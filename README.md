## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo on to your computer. You can do so with the [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/), or in a terminal with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/nityagop/c4c.git
```
3. Run `npm run dev` **at the root of this project** to start the app locally
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website

## Overview 
The main goal of this website is to allow C4C members to easily handle partner information. This website allows users to add partner information such as their name, description, thumbnail image, and whether they are active. When the partner information is no longer needed, users are able to delete that specific tile. 

## Design Decisions 
I decided to stray away from the given example slightly by placing the partner information boxes horizontally rather than in its own tile. 

## Reflection
As someone who does not have much web development background, the task seemed daunting at first but I overall enjoyed going through this exercise. I really appreciated having the starter code because it allowed me to gain an idea of the relationship between frontend and backend and how all the components worked together. The main issues I ran into were figuring out how to integrate the frontend and backend. Getting familiar with React was probably the most challenging part but I overcame these issues by looking at resources online and sample code.
